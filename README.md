# Visual Studio Code Extensions for Salesforce Documentation

This repository contains the source code for the Visual Studio Code extensions for Salesforce documentation. 

Currently, we have [SFDocs Markdown Preview](https://github.com/forcedotcom/sfdocs-vscode/blob/master/vscode-preview/README.md) extension. It extends the out of the box Markdown Preview provided by VSCode by adding support for MicroMark parser.
