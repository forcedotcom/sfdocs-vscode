# SFDocs Markdown Assistant

SFDocs Markdown Assistant makes it easier to write Markdown. Use shortcuts and easy routes for adding markdown syntax. Furthermore, you get authoring support for GFM tables and some advanced Markdown plugins. With SalesforceDocs Markdown Assistant, we got you covered for the markdown authoring experience inside Visual Studio Code.

SFDocs Markdown Assistant is compliant with CommonMark and GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM).

All features are available in the command palette. All features expect table cell navigation are also available in the context menu.

## Shortcuts

| Feature                        | Shortcut     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Toggle Bold                    | Ctrl/Cmd+B   |
| Toggle Italic                  | Ctrl/Cmd+I   |
| Toggle Strikethrough           | Alt/Option+S |
| Insert Link              | Ctrl/Cmd+L   |
| Insert a cross-reference (file) | Ctrl/Cmd+R   |
| Table: Next cell               | Tab          |
| Table: Previous cell           | Shift+Tab    |
| Insert Video                   | Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + M |

## Basic Styling

-   Toggle **Bold**, _Italic_, ~Strikethrough~, `Inline Code`, code blocks, and block quotes.
-   Make a hyperlink.
-   Add a cross-reference to another markdown file (with auto-complete suggestions for files in the repository).
-   Insert an image (with auto-complete suggestions for files in the repository).

Toggling works as expected when there is a selection in the editor.

Without a selection, enter Cmd+B to toggle bold on and off.

To style a word, click the word and toggle the styles, no selection required.

To revert styling, click the start or end of the stylized text and toggle the style.

Apply a blockquote to a single line. Click the line and select **Toggle Blockquote** .

## Lists

-   Toggle bulleted list.
-   Toggle numbered list.
-   Toggle check list.
-   Select a subset of check boxes.
-   Description list.

Select the lines to convert to a list and toggle the list type (bullet, numbered, checklist).

To convert a list to a different type of list, toggle the list type.

To select a subset of a checklist, select **Check List Items** from the context menu.

To cross out a list item, click the list item and toggle strikethrough.

`Enter`, `Tab`, and `Backspace` behave differently when used with lists.
- `Enter` key at the end of a list item creates a list item on the next line. If `Enter` is pressed again without typing anything for this list item, the list item is removed and the cursor goes to the next line. If you want a newline instead of a new list item, press `Shift+Enter`.
- `Tab` key converts the selected list item into  a sublist item.
- `Backspace` converts a sublist item into a normal list item, and a normal list item into normal text.
  

  
## Tables

-   Add a table (with default (left) alignment)
-   Add Table with Alignment (chosen by user)
-   Insert Row
-   Insert Column (Left/Right)
-   Delete Selected Rows
-   Delete Selected Columns
-   Move Row (Up/Down)
-   Move Column (Right/Left)
-   Copy Column
-   Paste Column (Right/Left, for the columns copied using copy column)
-   Paste Table (from sources like Quip, Sheets, and Excel)
-   Format (To make the table more readable)
-   Remove Formatting (To condense the table as formatting can lead to readability issues if the cell contents are too long)

Tables reformat as you type into a more readable format (if you navigate using Tab and Shift+Tab as mentioned).

![AutoFormat](https://github.com/forcedotcom/sfdocs-vscode/blob/master/vscode-markdown-assistant/images/Autoformat.gif?raw=true)

Tab (Next Cell) and Shift+Tab (Previous Cell) are the easiest ways to navigate through the cells.

To copy a table from a source other than Markdown and paste it in Markdown format, select **Table** > **Paste Table** from the context menu.
  
### Table Columns/Rows Editing

Select any portion of the rows or columns to delete and select **Table > Delete Selected Rows/Columns** from the context menu.

![DeleteRows](https://github.com/forcedotcom/sfdocs-vscode/blob/master/vscode-markdown-assistant/images/DeleteRows.gif?raw=true). 

In the following example, the rows corresponding to Food, Home and Medical were selected, and **Table > Delete Selected Rows/Columns** is chosen from the right click menu.
    
![DeleteColumns](https://github.com/forcedotcom/sfdocs-vscode/blob/master/vscode-markdown-assistant/images/DeleteColumns.gif?raw=true)

The columns corresponding to Budget and Actual were selected, and **Table > Delete Selected Columns** is chosen from the right click menu.
  
**Insert, move, copy, or paste a table row or a column**: Place the cursor on the required row/column and use the feature. (**Insert Row** on the header row inserts a new first row.)

## Custom Salesforce Plugins

-   Enhanced Calloutsâ€“Tip, Warning, Note, Caution
-   Enhanced Code blocks
-   Insert Video - VidYard, YouTube, Local file
